# python-template

Basic template for starting python projects

As any stand alone program I might want to make is going to have a similar base 
level of functionality, either by desire/need) (argument parsing) or just by 
general useful features to have (config files, logging) having a basic boilerplate 
framework to start from seemed like a reasonable idea.
